 * networkd:
   - add LLDP client side support
-  - ipv4ll with multiple interfaces doesn't work when both dhcp and
-    ipv4ll is used. for some reasons the kernel will currently pick an
-    ipv4ll source address to reach non-ipv4ll gateways.
   - the DHCP lease data (such as NTP/DNS) is still made available when
     a carrier is lost on a link. It should be removed instantly.
   - .network setting that allows overriding of the hostname to send to the dhcp server
